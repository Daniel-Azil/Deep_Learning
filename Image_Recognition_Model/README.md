## 0_Image_recognition_of_healthy_lung
This this file contains a deep learning learning model that can identify whether an image is an x-ray of a healthy lung or a lung with cancer. The model is a practical implementation of deep learning techniques using the PyTorch and fastai libraries, and it uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model for image recognition.

###Overview
The model analyzes x-ray images to determine whether they show signs of lung cancer. This project serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition and classification.
